# Combination Sum

**Problem from LeetCoder**

Given a set of candidate numbers (`candidates`) (without duplicates) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sums to `target`.

The same repeated number may be chosen from `candidates` unlimited number of times.

**Note** :
- All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

### Examples:

#### 1

**Input** : 
```java 
candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
```

**Output:** : 
```java 
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
```
#### 2

**Input** : 
```java
candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
```

**Output:** : 
```java
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
```
