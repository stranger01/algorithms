# Merge two sorted LinkedLists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. 
The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Implementation should have a method with two ListNode parameters.

**Input** : 

  ``` java
1->2->4, 1->3->4
   ``` 
   
**Output:** : 

  ``` java
1->1->2->3->4->4
   ```
