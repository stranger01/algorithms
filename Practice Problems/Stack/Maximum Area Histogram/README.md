# Maximum Area Histogram

**2003/2004 ACM ICPC University of Ulm Local Contest**

A histogram is a polygon composed of a sequence of rectangles aligned at a common base line. The rectangles have equal widths but may have different heights. Usually, histograms are used to represent discrete distributions, e.g., the frequencies of characters in texts. Note that the order of the rectangles, i.e., their heights, is important. Given, heights of rectangles, calculate the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram that is aligned at the common base line, too.

### Example:
**Input** : `[2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3]`

**Output:** : `8`
